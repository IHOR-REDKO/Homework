     <h2>Abaut my self :</h2>
       <p>Hello, I want to tell you about myself, from the very beginning of my informed life, I started doing sports professionally! 
        It was at the beginning of high school, after finishing school, I continued to do sports! 
        I decided to enter the University of Economics and Trade in the city of Poltava.
         After graduating from the university, I started working for several Ukrainian mobile communications companies! 
         After that, I started working with automobile spare parts for Japanese cars. 
        I continue to do the same now. It became very interesting for me to study the Front-End course! 
        Thus I am with you now!
